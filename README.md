piSlice - The simple, responsive template for [Joomla!] 3.x
--------------
The goal of piSlice is to provide a clean, simple, lightweight template that can be used standalone or as the building blocks of your next Joomla! template.
piSlice is also intended to showcase the new features of Joomla! 3.0+ such as the inclusion of [bootstrap] for a responsive layout and [jQuery], and is built with standards-compliant, semantic HTML5 and CSS3.
