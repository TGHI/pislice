pislice - The simple, responsive template for [Joomla!] 3.x
--------------
The goal of pislice is to provide a clean, simple, lightweight template that can be used standalone or as the building blocks of your next Joomla! template.
pislice is also intended to showcase the new features of Joomla! 3.1+ such as the inclusion of [Bootstrap] for a responsive layout and [jQuery], and is built with standards-compliant, semantic HTML5 and CSS3.

Features
--------------

- Customizable layout, fonts, colours and icons
- Theme manager to save/load themes
- [Google Fonts] support
- [OpenGraph] meta tag support for categories and articles
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Small size, small payload (Less than 200KB zipped)
